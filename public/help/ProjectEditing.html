  The project and experiment editors provide a drag and drop creation for
  Projects. Avalable Nodes are Task Nodes (which can represent any task), Filter
  Nodes, which represent filters for steps in an experiment or Project and
  Experiment Nodes, which represent self-contained subunits of a project. Task
  nodes can have outputs and persistant data.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Persistant data is data that can be accessed in other tasks (needs to be
      implemented for Javascript tasks)
    </li>
    <li>
      Output data is data that can be used by filters to determine the path of a
      participant through the project
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Filter nodes allow setting up filtes that lead the participant to different
    follow up nodes. A filter needs a mathematical expression based on the
    outputs of !previous! Tasks. If the expression evaluates to 0 the option
    will not be taken, if it evaluates to another value it will be taken. Make
    sure, that filter expressions are mutually exclusive, as the otherwise no
    guarantee is made as to which path is taken.

  <p>An example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Task FirstTask has the output Smoker, which can have the values 1 or 0
    </li>
    <li>
      Task SecondTask has the output Workout which can have the values 0, 1, 2,
      3
    </li>
    <li>
      We want to all non smoking active people to go to Task ThirdTask, and all
      others to FourthTask
    </li>
    <li>
      The Filter would then be:
      <code>FirstTask.Smoker = 0 & SecondTask.Workout > 1</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
