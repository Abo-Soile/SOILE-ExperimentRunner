<h3>The Filter Node</h3>
<p>
    A Filter Node represents a junction in the SOILE Project or experiment, where the next task depends on the results of previous tasks.
    A Filter is defined as a function that needs to evaluate to "true". 
</p>
<p> 
    Filters can use the following functionalities:
     <ul>
        <li>
            Operators such as  "+", "-", "*", "^" (power)
        </li>
        <li>
            The functions <code>mean(val1, val2, ...)</code>, <code>median(val1,val2,...)</code>, <code>min(val1,val2,...)</code>, <code>max(val1,val2,...)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            An approximation function that checks, whether two values are the same within a given tolerance: 
            <code>approx(A,B,tol)</code>, Where <code> abs(A - B) &lt; tol</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            logical operators: <code> | </code> (or), <code> & </code> (and), <code> = </code> (equal), <code> &lt; </code> (smaller), <code> &gt; </code> (larger)             
        </li>
     </ul>
     You can build any formaula with these operators. Best use parenthesis to make operation precedence clear.
</p>
<p>
    The values used in filters need to be defined as outputs in other tasks. and referenced as TaskID.outputName.
