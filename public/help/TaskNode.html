<h3>The Task Node</h3>
<p>
    A Task node represents an individua Task that was created in the Task editor. Tasks can be e.g. PsychoJS tasks, based on javascript,
    or using the <a href="https://abo-soile.github.io/SOILE-elang/" target="_blank">SOILE Experiment language</a> or the 
    <a href="https://abo-soile.github.io/SOILE-QuestionaireMarkup/" target="_blank">SOILE questionnaire language</a>. 
</p>
<p> In the project editor additional settings can be made for a task:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Outputs can be defined, which can be used in filter nodes. These outputs must reflect variables that are generated by the task. 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For Tasks using the SOILE Questionnaire lanugage, outputs can be any output that is generated by the questionnaire. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Tasks using the SOILE experiment language, outputs must be values saves as "savevariable". 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Javascript tasks must produce these outputs in the outputData field of their result function, and, unfortunately, psychoJS 
                    Tasks cannot currently produce outputs.
                </li>
            </ul>                                    
        </li>
        <li>
            Persistent data can also be defined. This is data that can be re-used in other tasks referencing to the same variable. Again, the tasks need to support this.            
            Currently only soile Experiment tasks ( via the <code> loadvariable </code> function ) and javascript tasks (via window.persistentData) can access persistent data.
            It can also be generated by Questionnaire language tasks, but unfortunately it cannot be accessed in those.
        </li>
    </ul>
