  <h3> Randomization Nodes</h3>
  <p>
    The Randomizer Node allows adding study level randomizatin to a project (or experiment). It acts similar to a filter node but instead of relying on 
    data from the participant to select the next step, it either randomly assigns (Basic Randomization) a next step, or assigns a next step based on the 
    number of participants that have passed this step and a assignment strategy (Block Randomization).    
    </p>
    <p> You can select the type of randomization when editing the node. For Basic randomizaion you can then select the number of Outputs (i.e. options) that are possible.
      For a block randomizer, the Options are generated from the Block specification string. Each character in the block specification represents one possiblity.
