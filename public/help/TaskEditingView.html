    When creating a new task, you are asked to select a language the task will
    be in along with a version of the language. The latter is less important for
    now.
  </p>
  <p>The available options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The SOILE Experiment language (docs can be found
      <a href="https://abo-soile.github.io/SOILE-elang/">here</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      The SOILE Questionnaire Language (docs can be found
      <a href="https://abo-soile.github.io/SOILE-QuestionaireMarkup/index.html"
        >here</a
      >)
    </li>
    <li>
      Tasks created by the PsychoPy Builder software (using
      <a href="https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs">PsychoJS</a> )
    </li>
    <li>Tasks using javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some more details about the options:</p>
  <h3>PsychoJS / PsychoPy</h3>
  <p>
    The main code file for PsychoJS tasks is the html file generated by the
    psychopy builder software. The actual js file, along with all resources
    (except the PsychoJS CSS files and libraries) needs to be added to the Task
    as additional files. We will create import functionalities for these tasks
    in the future. It is entirely possible, that some functionality of PsychoJS 
    is not yet fully supported, and we will have to slightly modify the 
    PsychoJS library in order to provide full support for tasks.
  </p>
  <h3> JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
    Same as for PsychoJS, the main code file for javascript has to be an html file that 
    loads the javascript. The javascript files loaded can be assumed to be at a relative position to 
    the task as indicated in the file browser.
    Javascript tasks need to use the following available end-points to produce outputs:
    <ul>
    <li> <code>window.submitFile(fileName : string, fileFormat : string, file : File)</code> : This function submits a file with the given mime type that will be added to the results of the given task.</li>
    <li> <code>window.reportResults(data : Object)</code> : This function will add Data in a JSON format to the results data for this task. NOTE: existing fields will not be merged but overwritten.</li>
    <li> <code>window.submitResults()</code> : This function submits the data to the database. Without calling it, all other data will not be stored.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Editing Tasks</h3>
  <p>The Task Editing View is separated into four parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Task Settings (top)</li>
    <li>File Browser (left)</li>
    <li>Editor (middle)</li>
    <li>Preview (right)</li>    
  </ul>
  <p>You can edit text files in the file browser (as long as they have an appropriate extension) via the main editor window.
    <span style="color: red">NOTE: when saving a file, the resulting change is NOT stored to the Task. Only the Save button in the Task Settings Menu will create
   a new, accessable version of the task</span></p>
