<h3>Setting up a filter</h3>
<p>
    Here you can modify a Filter node and add new Filter expressions. 
</p>
<h4> New Filter Options</h4>
<p> 
    If you want to create a new Filter option, enter a name in the Filter Name field of the Create New Filter block.
    Then, click on edit expressions and a Formula editor will open offering all outputs previously defined 
    in Task nodes. You can then create a formula which will be evaluated when a participant reaches this node.
    The Formula has to evaluate to 0 in order for the filter not to be selected. 
    Once you have created a formula and entered a name, you can click on "Create Filter" to  add the Filter Option to the edited node.
</p>

<h4> Modify existing Filters </h4>
<p> 
    To modify an existing Filter option, click on the "Edit" button beside the Filter option. 
    This will open an editing view where you can modify the Name or edit the formula by clicking on 
    "Edit Expression"
    After you have made all edits, press "Update Node" to update the node with the new values. 
    Keep in mind, that you will still have to save the experiment/project before the changed node can be used in
    a study.
</p>

<h4> Valid Formulas </h4>
<p>
    In addition to numbers and output variables and numbers, formulas can contain the following functions and operators
     <ul>
        <li>
            Operators such as  "+", "-", "*", "^" (power)
        </li>
        <li>
            The functions <code>mean(val1, val2, ...)</code>, <code>median(val1,val2,...)</code>, <code>min(val1,val2,...)</code>, <code>max(val1,val2,...)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            An approximation function that checks, whether two values are the same within a given tolerance: 
            <code>approx(A,B,tol)</code>, Where <code> abs(A - B) &lt; tol</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            logical operators: <code> | </code> (or), <code> & </code> (and), <code> = </code> (equal), <code> &lt; </code> (smaller), <code> &gt; </code> (larger)             
        </li>
     </ul>
     You can build any formaula with these operators. Best use parenthesis to make operation precedence clear.
